function varargout = finite(val, varargin)
%finite - Check that all elements are finite numbers
%
%   finite(val) checks that all elements of val are finite numbers.  If
%   they are, nothing else happens; if they are not, the function throws an
%   exception from the calling function.
%
%   finite(val, 'VarName') includes VarName in the exception message.
%
%   ME = finite(...) returns the MException object instead of throwing it
%   internally.  If no exception is created, ME will be an empty array.
%   This can be useful for combining multiple checks while still throwing
%   the exception from the original calling function.
%
%   See also isfinite, isnumeric, error, MException,
%   MException.throwAsCaller
