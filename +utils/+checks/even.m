function varargout = even(val, varargin)
%even - Check that all elements are even integers
%
%   even(val) checks that all elements of val are even integers.  If they
%   are, nothing else happens; if they are not, the function throws an
%   exception from the calling function.  Integers stored in non integer
%   numeric data types (e.g. single/double arrays) are also treated as
%   integers.  In this function inf is not counted as an integer.
%
%   even(val, 'VarName') includes VarName in the exception message.
%
%   ME = even(...) returns the MException object instead of throwing it
%   internally.  If no exception is created, ME will be an empty array.
%   This can be useful for combining multiple checks while still throwing
%   the exception from the original calling function.
%

%   MException.throwAsCaller
